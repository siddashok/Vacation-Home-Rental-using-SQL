# Vacation-Home-Rental-using-SQL
Design a Database system for a XYZ vacation home rental company

The aim of the project is to design a database system for a vacation home rental company, where we design the database, 
insert some sample data, and implement a set of required features. Each feature will be implemented as one or more Oracle 
PL/SQL procedures.

There is a list of assumptions and features taken into account for desigining the database. This can be more widely
understood through the Problem Statement and Report. 

The ER diagram guides you well with what are the major entities within the system scope, and the inter-relationships 
among these entities.


Steps to Run the code: 
1. Setup your Oracle Database
2. Run the Drop, Create, Insert and Select queries all together (you can find it inside "executable_queries.sql" )
3. Run the function and procedure for each feature one by one & see the changes to the table.
